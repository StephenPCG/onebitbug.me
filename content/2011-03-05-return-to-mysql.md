Though sqlite is quiet small and portable, there are too many plugins that won’t live with it.
At last, I give up sqlite, and return to MySQL.
I didn’t know what trouble I would met while transfering to MySQL, I just reinstalled my entire blog.
I lost all the comments :-(

For those who have subscribed to my blog’s RSS, the last five post will appear again, sorry for the noises.
